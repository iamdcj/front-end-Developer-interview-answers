# Answers to key Front-End Development questions

## What?
My attempt at answering common HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Performance questions. The bulk of the questions come from the [h5bp Front-end Job Interview Questions repository](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) and [Scott O'Hara's Accessibility Interview Questions page](https://scottaohara.github.io/accessibility_interview_questions/), the rest I've added myself from various sources.

## Why?
Despite having 6+ years experience building websites, I could only answer a small percentage of these questions confidently; I want to address that by making a daily effort to answer at least one of the questions across the various sections.
