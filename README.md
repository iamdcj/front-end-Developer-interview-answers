# Answers to common Front-End Interview questions

## What?
My attempt at answering questions related to the common front-end disciplines; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Performance, Network.

The bulk of the questions come from the [h5bp Front-end Job Interview Questions repository](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) and [Scott O'Hara's Accessibility Interview Questions page](https://scottaohara.github.io/accessibility_interview_questions/), the rest I've added myself from various sources.

## Why?
Despite having 6+ years experience building websites, I could only answer a small percentage of these questions confidently when I first read through them; I want to address that by making an effort to answer at least one of the questions across the various sections per month, with the goal of having answered them all thoroughly by May 13, 2020.
